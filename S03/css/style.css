/* 
    Provides a semantic media query from the following:
    Respond above XX(screen sizes)
    Respond below XX
    Respond between XX and XX

    Whereas:
    XX is the two letter bootstrap breakpoiny (i.e sm, md)

    SYNTAX for media query
    @media (min-width:768px) and (max-width: 991px)
    {
        Targer devices between 768 px and 992 px
    }

    It's best practice to use Bootstrap breakpoints in your own code but it's painful to write them all the time.

    - it checks both lower and upper keys exists in the breakpoints before writing this in the media query
